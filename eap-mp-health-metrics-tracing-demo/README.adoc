= JBoss Enterprise Application Server Health, Metrics and Tracing on JBoss EAP XP 2.0
:toc:
:source-highlighter: highlight.js
:imagesdir: ../images

== Running with EAP Locally

- Download and install JBoss EAP 7.3
- Patch JBoss EAP 7.3 to latest patch
- Download and install EAP XP 2.0 over the EAP 7.3 patched install
- Ensure to have JBOSS_HOME setup on your path
- Setup an admin user

Build the code
[source,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean compile
----

To run this application in the local application server, run the JBoss Server and deploy the war through
the server admin console

Note:

----
Running with this method will default to the following uri:
http://localhost:8080/eap-mp-health-metrics-tracing-demo/
----

== Running the Bootable JAR Application Locally

To run this Bootable application on your local host:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean package -Pbootable-jar
----

Once the build is succeeded, run the bootable jar:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ java -jar target/eap-mp-health-metrics-tracing-demo-bootable.jar
----

== Interacting with the Bootable JAR Application Locally

To interact with your Bootable application while it's running locally, use the form at `http://localhost:8080` or the `curl` command:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/rest/json
{"result":"Hello, JBoss EAP 7.3 with MicroProfile!"}

$ curl http://localhost:8080/rest/xml
<xml><result>Hello, JBoss EAP 7.3 with MicroProfile!</result></xml>
----

== Using Jaeger to see tracing output

In order to run and test with Jaeger, we will use the all-in-one docker image:
[source,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ docker run -d --name jaeger \
  -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HOST_PORT=:9411 \
  -p 5775:5775/udp \
  -p 6831:6831/udp \
  -p 6832:6832/udp \
  -p 5778:5778 \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 14268:14268 \
  -p 14250:14250 \
  -p 9411:9411 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one
----

Additional information can be found here:

link:https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.22/getting-started/[Jaeger Tracing with Docker]

To run the Jaeger UI, browse to http://localhost:16686

- Make sure Jaeger is running prior to starting the JBoss Server.

- If you are running with JBoss locally, you will find your service listed in the
service dropdown.

- If you are running in a bootable jar, you will find the ROOT.war listed in the
service dropdown.

- Select the service and choose the JSON option in the application page.  Then in
Jaeger UI, select the Find Traces button and you will see your trace.

== Using Prometheus for metrics output

We will use a docker image for Prometheus as well to see metrics output

[source,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ docker run -p 9090:9090 -v /tmp/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus
----

In order to do this, we must use the prometheus.yml file in the projects, configuration
directory.  We will put that into the /tmp directory for this test.

For more about the link:https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/prometheus[prometheus image]

For more about using the link:https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/prometheus/[prometheus image]

Make sure to run the Prometheus image first.  Then start either your JBoss locally
or the application in a bootable jar.

Navigate to http://localhost:9090/targets and you will see several options now based on
the prometheus.yml configuration.

Not select the *Classic UI* menu option.

Here, you can create a graph with several options:

Choose what you wish to look at.

== Running the Bootable JAR Application on OpenShift Cluster:

To deploy your Bootable JAR application, be sure to login with your credential and create a new project in OpenShift cluster:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD

$ oc new-project eap-mp-health-metrics-tracing-demo

$ mvn clean oc:deploy -Pbootable-jar-openshift
----

Go to `Developer console` then you should see that a pod is running. When you click on `Open URL` in Topology view, you will see the GUI to invoke the REST API.
